# IdentityGuard  
**Identity-Preserving Portrait Refinement, Governed by Gemini**

Most AI photo tools optimize for beauty — and slowly erase identity.  
IdentityGuard takes the opposite approach.

We built a professional-grade portrait refinement engine that **improves perception without changing who a person is**, using Gemini as a governing intelligence rather than a simple generator.

## 🚨 The Problem

Modern AI photo apps:
- Over-smooth skin
- Alter facial geometry
- Push everyone toward the same synthetic look

This causes **identity drift**, inconsistency over time, and ethical risks in professional contexts like journalism, dating platforms, and corporate profiles.

---

## ✅ The Solution

IdentityGuard is a **constrained AI pipeline** that:
- Validates images before processing
- Explicitly separates immutable identity anchors from modifiable nuances
- Uses Gemini to reason, plan, self-correct, and verify
- Refuses to proceed when safety conditions are violated

We don’t beautify people.  
We preserve identity while restoring how people look at their best.

## 🧠 Why Gemini?

Gemini is not used as a passive generator.

It actively:
- Performs schema-constrained image validation
- Extracts identity anchors and non-negotiable constraints
- Translates high-level user intent into safe refinement goals
- Generates and evaluates its own retouch plans
- Verifies identity preservation post-generation

Gemini governs the system — and corrects itself when needed.

## 🧩 How It Works

1. User selects **usage context** (LinkedIn, Dating, Corporate, etc.)
2. Context is translated into constrained refinement goals
3. Gemini validates the image (quality, face count, suitability)
4. Identity anchors are extracted and locked
5. A goal-aligned retouch plan is generated
6. Refinement is applied with perceptibility checks
7. Identity verification is enforced
8. A single safety-bounded retry is allowed if needed
9. Final image is delivered or safely rejected

---

## 🔐 Safety & Ethics

- Zero tolerance for identity geometry changes
- Explicit rejection of unsafe or ambiguous inputs
- No direct user control over facial anatomy
- Single-retry limit to prevent iterative drift

This system is designed for **trust, consistency, and accountability**.

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

- Optimized for single-face portraits
- Best results under reasonable lighting conditions
- Not intended for heavy stylization or creative alteration

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. Upload a portrait photo
2. Select the intended usage context
3. Click **Analyze and refine**
4. Review the refined result and identity-safe feedback

---

## 🔮 Product Vision

IdentityGuard is designed for any domain where **authenticity is currency** — professional profiles, journalism, dating platforms, and ethical AI imaging systems.
