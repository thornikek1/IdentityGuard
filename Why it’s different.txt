Why it’s different:

* Identity anchors are explicitly extracted and locked

* Gemini governs decisions instead of blindly generating images

* Refinement plans are evaluated for perceptibility and safety

* A self-correction loop prevents both over-editing and no-change outputs

* UI exposes intent, not anatomy

* Safety failures terminate the pipeline instead of producing risky results
